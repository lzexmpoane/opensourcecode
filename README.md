In the Code, from left to right is:Upload files , Test files , Programming examination questions , Sample files

You can't upload any files in the "Upload files", because it's under development.

But you can preview it looks like after uploading.

For example:

#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    cout<<"HelloWorld!";
    return 0;
}
```
```python
# Python
print("HelloWorld")
```
```Java
//Java
public class HelloWorld {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
              System.out.println("Hello World!");
       }
}
```
Save it as a file.

Click "选择文件" button,

Then you can see what is it looks like after upload.
